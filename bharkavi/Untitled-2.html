   <h2><b>What is Prosthetic Arm?</b></h2>
   <p>Prosthetics, or artificial limbs, are used to replace limbs that were lost or absent limbs from birth. They enable those with congenital limb differences and amputees alike to improve function and mobility</p>

   <h3><b>How does Prosthetic Arm work?</b></h3>
   <p>A prosthetic hand can improve your quality of life by allowing you to engage in many of the same activities you participate in before the loss of a limb. <b>There are passive, or non-functional, prosthetic hands that are devised mainly to approximate the look of biological hands.</b> But when it comes to functional prosthetic hands, these devices can give you varying range of motion and control of movement depending on the type of prosthetic hand you can receive. </p>
