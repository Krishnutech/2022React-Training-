Battery replacement
If your battery has an issue that's covered by the Apple Limited Warranty, AppleCare+, or consumer law, we'll service your iPhone at no additional cost. Our warranty doesnâ€™t cover batteries that wear down from normal use. If your battery wears down, we offer out-of-warranty battery service for a fee.

If you have AppleCare+, it covers your iPhone for no additional charge if your product's battery holds less than 80 percent of its original capacity. We might need to test your product to find the cause of your battery issue.

Other iPhone repairs
Do you need a repair for other issues like the Home button, liquid damage, or an accessory?

If your iPhone issue is covered by the Apple warranty, AppleCare+, or consumer law, there's no charge. This does not include accidental damage, which requires a fee.<br></br>
If your iPhone was damaged and you have AppleCare+, the coverage includes accidental damage protection. Each incident has a service fee.
If your iPhone was damaged and you don't have AppleCare+, your repair fee will vary, depending on the repair. Apple Authorized Service Providers may set their own fees
